My code is comprised of 3 files. Chatkey.env which contains the OpenAI API Key. 
EarlyDetection.py which acts as the main file. Once run please use http://127.0.0.1:7860/ 
to view the project. And finally chatmem.json which acts as a storage holder for previous 
chat histories.

This project demonstrated how a large language model can be used to identify early signs 
of neurodegenerative diseases through open conversation. The chatbot engaged users in 
a natural dialogue, asking targeted questions and responding based on symptoms related 
to memory, language, movement, and behaviour. Using tools like chatmem.json and 
LlamaIndex, the assistant was able to simulate memory and retrieve relevant past cases 
to improve its predictions. Testing showed strong performance in controlled scenarios, 
and the feedback loop helped the system refine its reasoning over time.
